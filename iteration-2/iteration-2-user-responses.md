### Wenxiao Men, NYU CAS Student 25’

* [ ] Have something explain the structure of the exercise&#x20;
* [ ] Explicitly say “You have this amount of time to do the warmup exercise”
* [ ] When the timer ends it prints to the console, it should appear on the canvas itself
* [ ] Having two buttons, once you generate an idea the timer starts, but if you want to give up, you just move on
* [ ] There’s no direct implication of finishing just add “finish this warmup exercise BEFORE THE TIMER runs out”

### Lila Ablimit, NYU IDM 24’

* [ ] When you click GENERATE idea, the pie chart displays as full for a frame
* [ ] When the pie chart finishes, it would be cool to have a CONGRATULATIONs message with something like pinata exploding on the screen
* [ ] Link the click to the timer starting

### Aisha Njau, NYU IDM 25’

* [ ] There should be an option for the clock to reset
* [ ] The way the clock displays is really cool
* [ ] the button works imediately and makes the user experience clear
