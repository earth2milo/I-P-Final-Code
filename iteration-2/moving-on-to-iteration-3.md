# ðŸ“š Moving on to Iteration 3!

For this round of feedback, I largely focused on the user-experience aspect of the controls for my project. The timer I made serves as this sort of tool to continue progressing through the exercise. I wanted to set it at a relatively fast time, but not too fast so that a user is not intimidated by time-constraints. I  want to make the user more interested and attached in using the program. Which makes me want to explore a sort of splash screen that serves as a preamble for my project. This would create structure for the exercise.
