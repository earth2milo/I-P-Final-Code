# Response to User Feedback

For this iteration I wanted to hone down on the technical aspects of the project since it was my last iteration, and I wanted to make sure ALL technical issues were ironed out. Which would explain why 2 of my users were computer science students. Their feedback was invaluable for helping me fix my code, and make my project more effective.
