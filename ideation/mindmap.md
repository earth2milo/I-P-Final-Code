  My ideation method for this project. I had a great variety of different routes
  to embark upon with this project, so it was especially important for me to go
  down the metaphorical trail of each idea.

My Mindmap
{% endfile %}

This ideation method was apt for this project as it gave me time and clarity to move on with my project. After careful consideration, the idea that seemed the most impossible (Consistent Canvas puzzles or challenges) ended up becoming the idea I would execute for this project. I wanted to combine my coding skills acquired from Creative Coding  with the skills I learned within the Ideation and Prototyping  courseflow. This would entail coding a project fully with different iterations, feedback, and a more expansive focus on user experience and human-centered design.
