# üßëüöÄ Ideation and Prototyping Final Project

## Prompt: As an artist, I want a resource that inspires me and helps me overcome my creative blocks.

For this final project, I wanted to focus on a personal issue. How to tackle creative blocks, and how can other creatives help each other through creative humps?

For documenting my work, we find ourselves on GitBook, I found Gitbook to be an extremely seamless process for documenting my whole workflow. It‚Äòs low commitment, extremely easy to edit, allows for so much flexibility, yet gives a great deal of structure for my work. For more examples of my work on my gitbook, please refer to my MidTerm Portfolio.&#x20;

_Light disclaimer: (The cover pages for most pages are artworks made by me, and are completely unrelated to the project itself. I felt like having my work on the cover would add more visual ‚Äúflavor‚Äù or ‚Äúappeal‚Äù to scrolling through my workflow.)_
